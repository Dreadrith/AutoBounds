# AutoBounds
AutoBounds's purpose is to make easier to set the bounds of skinned mesh renderers so that they don't disappear in your peripherals especially when the avatar is not in a standing pose

# How To Use
Menu items can be found in the top left corner of the Unity Editor window
[DreadTools > Utility > AutoBounds]

## Automatic
This will set all the skinned mesh renderers of the target to the same automatically calculated bounds and sets the hip/root bone as the target. 

1- Select the root of your avatar.  
2- Press the menu item: [DreadTools > Utility > AutoBounds > Auto]

## Sample
This will set all the skinned mesh renderers that are children to the top most parent of the target to the same bounds and root bone as the target.

1- Select the target that you want to sample from.  
2- Press the menu item: [DreadTools > Utility > AutoBounds > Sample]
